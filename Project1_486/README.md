Project 1


#What is the topic?
Analysis of Middle Earth from LOTR :)
#What are the data and where is the data obtained from (provide links too)?
Middle Earth contours, various environmental and development shapefiles
#Can I find tower and keep building shapes instead of just points??
    https://github.com/jvangeld/ME-GIS 
#Are there any necessary transformations or subsets you need to do to the data?
    Transform contours into DEM/Hillshade
    Using R (https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-as-gis-for-ecologists/ )
    Clip DEM to Middle Earth Coastline boundaries
#What is the analysis you'll be performing on your data sets?
	  Density of hamlets, towers and keeps, towns, ruins?
	  Somehow compare to topography?? Strategic placement??
	  Network analyses of paths traveled by fellowship??
#What outputs will you be creating and how are they directly connected to the class?
	Contours > DEM/Hillshade using R
	Attempt to create 3D map of points where towers and keeps are, or volcanism
  	Heat map? Density of hamlets, towers and keeps, towns, ruins?
