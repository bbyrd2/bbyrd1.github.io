## Project 6

**Project description:** 
Using rtweet, I created a map that compares the tweets in the United States that are geotagged and reference either Covid-19 or Unemployment. The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted many businesses and caused an increase in unemployment. The states in purple have a higher number of tweets referencing unemployment. The states in green have a higher number of tweets referencing Covid-19. New York is one of the states with more tweets about unemployment, most likely due to the extensive quarantine measures that have taken place in the state. With continuing additions of strict quarantine rules, it is important to understand how this is affecting people's livelihoods.
