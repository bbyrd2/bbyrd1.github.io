## Project 2

This was my cumulative 4 year project studying the presence of wildlife at Eden Mill Nature Center. Over the vours of four years I conductued surveys of wildlife each season. I wanted to determine the effect of seaonality on the type and presence of wildlife. I studied two different habitats: a meadow and a riarian buffer trail.
